EMAIL FROM SK ON 2013/11/12:

  [x] 1. the body copy font on the back isn't the correct font
  [x] 2. photo and writer credits have problems
  [x] 3. comma's too tight against the copy on the top.  idea: take out the comma altogether from the back?  seems to me any copy is going to run up against it and be tight, and i think we should teach the reader that all drawer functions happen from the front/image side.   would make a HUGE difference in spacing/design.

  YES THIS MADE HUGE DIFFERENCE, ADJUSTED SPACING AND EVERYTHING LOOKS MUCH BETTER NOW

  [x] 4. some commas too light to see (hotel post on mexican hotel)

  SWITCHED TO USING DROP SHADOW VERSION OF THE COMMAS, THAT SEEMS TO HELP

  [?] 5. mike: i wasn't saying that, when you open the drawer and hit "dining" that the word "dining" has to flash--unless you'll need it for a transition time to load the images/cards).  i was saying that the word "dining" in the drawer should somehow react to be chosen, ie  it lights up, but in the drawer.

  SORRY JUST DONT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE ASKING FOR. SUGGEST WE GO WITH AS-IS FOR NOW THEN REVISIT IN PERSON WHEN YOU'RE BACK.

  [ ] 6. lou: since we have new procedures for address, phone, and price, work out with charlie the new spacing/character specs for the back of the cards so we can see how new actual card copy fits. for example: back of the flask article cuts off the  writer/photo credits.
  [ ] 7.  lou/charlie: going forward, no more than three lines for the title on the front. the flask title is too tall.
  [x] 8. comma on the front should come down a little.  too close to browser window--i tried to hit the comma and activated the browser window on accident.

  MOVED IT DOWN, ALSO ADDED CLICK AREA AROUND IT SO SHOULD BE HARDER TO MISS.


FROM EMAILS ON 2013/11/12:

  [ ] TODO: charle's needs help with making background image full-screen for desktop site

  [ ] via sk: when i hit "take me to the site" button on mailchimp, i get the desktop landing. if i were to hit it on mobile, i'd go to the "slide up for more cards" mobile gray landing page, correcto?

  SOUNDS GOOD IN FUTURE BUT THAT WILL TAKE SOME WORK, RIGHT NOW IT JUST SENDS EVERYONE TO DESKTOP LANDING.

  [x] via louis: Can we add a drop shadow for increased legibility on the front of the cards? Like where the headline is? Also, not sure it needs to be bold?

  ADDED DROP SHADOW.

  [ ] Image Aspect Ratio: Switch to 640x1136 images so that they fit iphone5
  [ ] Add Quote Cards support to the CMS



FROM MEETING WITH LOUIS: 

  [x] Layout on iPhone 5 (use black background?)
  [x] How does it look on Android?
  [x] Can we make phone numbers active?

FROM EMAIL: 

  [ ] 1. cookies: need to drop.  saved some stuff, went back on my phone again, wasn't saved.

  [x] 2.  need to see cms and determine flow of future content.  MG can't be putting in articles daily for us!

  STILL MANY CMS TODOS BUT SITE IS NOW LOADING CONTENT FROM IT

  [?] 3.  follow button needs to be added to drawer 

  NEED NEW DESIGN FOR DRAWER BUTTONS - THE ICONS ON BOTTOM WONT WORK IN SAFARI

  [x] 4.  when i hit "the latest", goes back to mobile landing page rather than first article (foie gras). 

  [x] 5.  Robert's "saved!" button needs to go in. 

  [x] 6.  underlined links need to be live and tapping them doesn't flip image

  [x] 7.  category choices need to "light up" when hit.

  [x] 8.  transition time from hitting category choice and going to category slow

  [-] 9.  when i slide up the landing home page quickly (flick it) the browser doesn't shrink up and footer doesn't disappear.  only happens when i pull up card slowly.

  THAT IS JUST HOW SAFARI WORKS, CANT CHANGE IT. ONLY SOLUTION CHANGE OUR DESIGN.

  [x] 10.  hamburger/comma logo needs to be put in
 
  [?] 11.  need to get you t and c and About copy--lou, i'll do.

  [-] 12.  lock design on phone into vertical

  UPDATED TO RESPONSIVE DESIGN AS DISCUSSED AT $THQ

  [x] 13.  Tap to Flip "flashing banner"--same design as robert's "saved!" flashing banner needs to go in between mobile landing page and first article page (foie gras)

  [-] 14.  Tap to Flip "flashing banner" needs to appear whenever anyone comes to our site (ie from a related content ad we're buying)

  USING UNBOUNCE PAGES INSTEAD

  [x] 15.  load times super slow (fixed with heroku etc?)

  MUCH FASTER NOW
